I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, supervised by [Prof. Bin Ran](https://topslab.wisc.edu/about/people/bin-ran/). I earned my B.S. (2020) and M.S. (2022) in Traffic Engineering from Southeast University in Nanjing, China.

I focus on the research and development of intelligent connected autonomous vehicles and infrastructures in transportation systems. By leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, I aim to advance autonomous driving technology in complex traffic scenarios. My research covers trajectory prediction and planning for autonomous vehicles, cooperative driving automation in complex traffic environments, and roadside-device-based localization and work zone data detection. I hope to gradually promote the adoption of autonomous vehicles, connected and autonomous vehicles, and intelligent transportation facilities from a practical perspective, truly integrating the needs of academia, automakers, road construction companies, transportation technology firms, and transportation policymakers.

## Research Interests
- Integration and innovation of artificial intelligence and machine learning in connected and autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems  
- Human-driven vehicle motion prediction and autonomous vehicle trajectory planning  
- Intelligent transportation system integration powered by large language models  
- Spatiotemporal data modeling and transportation network analysis  
- Development of V2X communication data pipeline systems
